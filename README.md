# LARJD-large-active-radar-jamming-database-
This dataset contains time-series signals of radar active jamming, which are used for research related to radar active jammingrecognition.

This dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is 3.5 GB in total, consisting of five .tsv files, each representing 19 types of radar interference in five radar operating frequency bands, with 500 randomly sampled instances per interference type. The testing set is 1.4 GB in total, containing five .tsv files, each representing 19 types of radar interference in five radar operating frequency bands, with 200 randomly sampled instances per interference type.
